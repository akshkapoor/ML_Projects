In this challenge, we need to build a predictive model that answers the question: 
“what sorts of people were more likely to survive the titanic disaster?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Explained the process followed with the code. Achieved an accuracy of 75% on the test set using Kernel SVM with 'rbf' kernel.
