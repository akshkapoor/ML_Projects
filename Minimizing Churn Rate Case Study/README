This case study is about a Finance Tracking App from a big company. It wants to minimize its churn rate by predicting which users are most
likely to churn. The dataset contains many features such as age of the user, whether he is an android user or an ios user, whether he was
referred by someone or not etc. Based on these we have to predict the value of the response variable i.e. Churn.
We started by analyzing the dataset and plotting the histograms of all the independent variables and pie chart distributions of the
binary features.
We had a couple of insights based on which we did feature engineering and finally applied our ML Model to the training set.
We got an accuracy score of 72% with Random Forest Classifier.
