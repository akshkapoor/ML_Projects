Market:- Target audience is set of loan applicants who reached out through an intermediatory market place.
Our goal is to predict the quality of applicants i.e. the people who reach the e-signing process.

We started with the EDA process by analyzing the features, plotting charts such as histograms, Correlations bar plot of independent
variables with response variable and correlations heatmap.

We then went ahead with model training using XGBoost. Used Grid Search to tune the hyperparameters.
Finally, got an accuracy score of 64%.
